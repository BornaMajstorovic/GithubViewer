# GitHub Repository Viewer

## Project Overview

GitHub Repository Viewer is a simple iOS app developed in Swift and SwiftUI that allows users to interact with the GitHub public API to display an endless paginated list of repositories. Users can view repository details, such as stars, forks, size, contributors, and their contributions. The app follows best software practices, focusing on modularity, SOLID principles, and code reusability. It uses a composable architecture to create a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Composable Architecture

The GitHub Repository Viewer app is built using the Composable Architecture, a modern architectural pattern inspired by the Elm architecture and Redux. Composable Architecture encourages a unidirectional data flow and modularization of the application.
